    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. Across the globe, it is reshaping industries, governance, education, and the way humans interact with machines. India, being the world’s most populous nation and a rapidly growing economy, has witnessed a remarkable rise in AI adoption and innovation. The journey of AI in India reflects a blend of government initiatives, private sector investments, academic contributions, and entrepreneurial zeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth and Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "India’s digital ecosystem provides fertile ground for AI growth. With over 800 million internet users, the world’s largest pool of data scientists and engineers, and a thriving startup culture, the nation is uniquely positioned to become a global AI hub. AI applications in India span across diverse sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, education, finance, manufacturing, and governance. For example, AI-based crop monitoring systems help farmers improve yield, while AI-driven diagnostic tools assist doctors in early detection of diseases.\n",
